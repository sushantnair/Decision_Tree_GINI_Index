# Decision_Tree_GINI_Index
A Python implementation of the Decision Tree Algorithm

## Purpose
This code is meant to foster an in-depth understanding of the Decision Tree Algorithm used in Machine Learning.

## Implementation Details
This code has been written purely in Python to implement the ID3 Decision Tree Algorithm used in Machine Learning.

### Libraries Used
Pandas for dataframe manipulation
Graphviz for visualization of the Decision Tree
Combinations (in Itertools library) to generate combinations of values of variable (column)

### Special Note
No ML algorithms like Scikit-learn, PyTorch or TensorFlow has been used. This is intentional,
so that every step of the process is coded for better understanding of the algorithm.

## Issues
There are currently **three** issues, which I'd like the learner to solve for better understanding
of the algorithm by practical experience. The issues can be found in the issues section

## Licensing
GNU General Public Licence. You may use the code for free, no attribution required (although it'd be
appreciated!).
